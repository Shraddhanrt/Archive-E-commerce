                    <p class="about__content--desc mb-20">The modern world brought advancement and ease in our lives, but at the same time introduced a new  setback  called obesity or being in an unhealthy BMI range. Our ancestors, who were very close to nature and herbs, may never have felt this physical condition in their life. Judging from the present situation, we can obviously see that our current lifestyle revolves around time, where we have minimal physical activity, and our meals are not well taken care of.
</p>
                    <p class="about__content--desc mb-25">Furthermore, it must be agreed that our body is at its best when we are living life close to nature and its magic. This kind of less physical activity and more time rushing lifestyle has brought in one of the most suffered diseases called obesity (according to an study by MOH,  in 2020 there is 54.2% of overweight and obese adult in Malaysia). Obesity is when abnormal or excessive fat accumulation may impair an individual's health.</p>
